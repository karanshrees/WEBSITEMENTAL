        <p>"The rate of a number of people that are committing suicide correct me if I'm wrong one in every 4 , one in every 3, one in evry 4 people is different. It's not like any other medical symptoms where you  actually see the medical symptoms if you have a diabetes or anything or headache.These are things  for some reason people easily accept but strangely when it comes to the mind people sort of feel like you know it's in your control no---no everything  will be fine .And you know like people ,someone will come and nudge you and say come on cheer up and it's all ok and I think a lot of it is also because of lack of knowledge even if people are aware of mental illness and there is sort of stigma attached to it which is ,let's not talk about it you can't take medication for your mind and your brain nobody does that what are other people
        going to think, you are gonna lose the personality ,job or many.The reason why I chose to speak up is because if in doing so if I can impact one life, Ah!!! I have lost a friend couple of years ago and so for me I think even  if I can impact one life in this entire process of sharing my story .Letting people know it's that something I have been through and something I would deal with because I had a fantastic support system. A lot of time it's not only the person who is suffering .There are a lot of people who are ready and willing to help but it's the immediate family and friends around who sort of suppress them and say no no you can't go to doctor nobody does this."</p>

        <p> I realised something was wrong I realised I was being different I wouldn't pinpoint what the issue was
        feeling empty ,pitted stomach feeling ,walking up like feeling directional less I didn't know what to do, where to go. I have  these bount of feeling so low that I just start crying at the drop of the hat(...incomplete..)!
